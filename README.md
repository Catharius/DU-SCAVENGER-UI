# DU-SCAVENGER-UI

The scavenger UI allow you to bookmark tiles and will remember when you visited them.
It also should work in space and will tell you if you have been to this area.

Useful when doing a planet scan in search of abandonned constructs or simply tell you if you have already been to a specific place

if you are more than 1km away of the last bookmark :
